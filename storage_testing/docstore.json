concept\n8.1 The six key decisions you need to make simultaneously\nDeveloping a structural design concept is similar in many ways to solving a set of simultaneous equations, except\nthat there is often more than one solution which meets the brief.\n\nWe will look at the following six key items to be considered, and decisions to be made, when developing a\nconceptual design:\n\n1. Influence of ground conditions.\n2. Material selection.\n3. Structural system \u2014 loadbearing, framed or hybrid.\n4. Grids and structural layouts.\n5. Spans of floor and roof structures.\n6. On- or off-site/prefabricated construction.\n\nThere are also many other valid considerations e.g. the integration of structure and building services.\n\nWhile each item is presented separately, these should all be considered at the same time, ideally. This is something\nthat becomes easier with experience, and almost happens subconsciously after several years of practise. Concept\ndesign often tends to be an iterative process.\n\nIt is also important to note that making one decision, or selecting one parameter e.g. which material to use, will\nusually have an impact on the choices available in relation to other parameters. For example, if it was decided,\npossibly for reasons of sustainability, that a timber floor system was to be used in a particular building, this would\nhave implications on the spacing of the supporting walls, beams and columns. Similarly, if loadbearing timber or\nmasonry walls were adopted for the building, this would place limitations on the overall height of the building.\n\nWhile not listed here as a \u2018key decision\u2019, it is also essential to think about stability and robustness when developing\nyour concept design (Chapter 9).\n\n8.1.1 Decision 1: Influence of ground conditions\nIt is easy to fall into the trap of carrying out the concept design of the superstructure of a building with little, if any,\nconsideration of the ground conditions. The foundation design is often carried out after that of the superstructure,\nand is often a \u2018fait accompli\u2019 i.e. the foundations will be whatever they need to be in order to resist the applied loads.\nThis could however lead to significant issues later in the project, potentially resulting in foundations solutions being\nadopted which are both impractical and uneconomical. It is good practice to get an understanding of the likely\nground conditions as early as possible, by carrying out a desk study (Chapter 7). Indeed, the ground conditions may\nhave significant implications for the superstructure design.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 106, "end_char_idx": 2915, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cd52093-c117-463f-905a-f94be7c76ff6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cd52093-c117-463f-905a-f94be7c76ff6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9686dfcd-e5ca-46b4-a7f6-b3e524df4cc8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2bcf6cd06dab6027de76320f4c524dcd5c8a3b72a9f5272a8082f999af24e56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "96  | The Institution of Structural Engineers\n     Conceptual design of buildings\n\nA good example is Walsall College in the West Midlands, which is built over old limestone mine workings, which occur\nat a depth of approximately 40m local to the proposed building. Figure 8.1 is a plan showing the mine workings\n(note that the areas shaded in grey are the voids).\n\nFigure 8.1:     Mine abandonment plan local to Walsall College\n                                                9377\nThe local authority stipulated that the total dead and imposed load of the building should not exceed 40kN/m2           at\nground level. Given that the proposed building was five storeys high in some areas, and that the imposed floor load\nwas typically either 4.0kN/m2 or 5.0kN/m 2, this limited the floor dead load to approximately 3.0kN/m 2 at each level.\nThe design team quickly concluded that a steel frame was the only viable solution, which not only complied with this\nstringent loading requirement, but also provided the flexible space requested in the client\u2019s brief.

8.2:     Walsall College\n\n8.1.2 Decision 2: Material selection\nThere are four commonly used structural materials to choose from when designing buildings in the UK:\n\n\u2022   Steel\n\u2022   Concrete\n\u2022   Timber\n\u2022   Masonry\n\nIn other countries, some of these materials may not be as readily available e.g. the steelwork industry in many\ncountries is not as well developed, while other materials, such as lightweight steel framing, and even bamboo and\nearth may be used, particularly for domestic construction.\n\nIn many cases, a hybrid material solution will be appropriate e.g. steel frame buildings often use concrete shear walls\nor cores, while loadbearing masonry buildings commonly use timber floor construction.\n\nMaterial selection depends on a wide range of considerations, typically:\n\n\u2022   Building height\n\u2022   Internal layout    \u2014 open plan or cellular\n\u2022   Structural form/spans \u2014 usually related to internal layout considerations\n\u2022   Ground conditions and any limitations on the location of foundations e.g. adjacent buildings, underground services\n    or tunnels\n\u2022   New build, refurbishment or extension e.g. the additional loads are likely to be limited for a refurbishment or\n    extension, whereas the floor-to-floor heights will also be dictated by the need to tie into existing floor levels\n\u2022   Magnitude and nature of applied loads\n\u2022   Sustainability/embodied carbon\n\u2022   Cost, availability and lead-in time\n\u2022   Fire resistance\n\u2022   Acoustic properties\n\u2022   Building physics e.g. lighting, ventilation etc.\n\u2022   Distribution of building services\n\u2022   Robustness/disproportionate collapse\n\u2022   Aesthetics\n\u2022   Design life, durability and maintenance requirements\n\u2022   Preconceived ideas/previous experience\n\nTable 8.1 shows indicative values for each of the four most common building materials.\n\nSimilarly, each material has its advantages and disadvantages, some of which are listed in Table 8.2.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 108, "end_char_idx": 2200, "text_template":

The gridlines shown on\nengineer\u2019s and architect\u2019s drawings should coincide with column and/or loadbearing wall locations (although changes\nmade during the design development period can result in members being moved off-grid).\n\nGrids should ideally be regular/uniform and perpendicular, to simplify fabrication/construction and maximise\neconomies of scale etc. Gridlines should also be consistent over the full height of the building, in order to avoid the\nneed for transfer structures.\n\nThere is often a trade-off between flexibility and economy when determining the structural grid. While placing\nsupports as far apart as possible might seem like a good idea, as it maximises the future flexibility of a building,\nthis comes at a cost. A practical and affordable compromise needs to be reached.\n\nGrid dimensions generally depend on various factors, including:\n\n\u2022    Proposed building use/gravity loads\n\u2022    Proposed room layouts\n\u2022    Future flexibility requirements\n\u2022    Presence of car parking under building\n\u2022    Spanning capability of proposed floor and roof structures\n\u2022    Spanning capability of proposed cladding solution\n\nFurther guidance regarding optimum grid dimensions is given on:\n\n\u2022    Offices\n\u2022    Residential\n\u2022    Car parks\n\u2022    Transfer structures\n\u2022    Optimum module sizes and construction materials", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1729, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b95d452a-b427-41bc-8000-39ffcf3dabf9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b95d452a-b427-41bc-8000-39ffcf3dabf9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6a3c6dbe-f02e-4a2a-9702-2b7d054e77de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d14f5cee3258810cca2a0624c143a3fa271c0992083d603ba4b504409a02114c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Institution of Structural Engineers  | 105\n                                                                                                                    Conceptual design of buildings\n\nOffices\nThe British Council for Offices (BCO)\u2019s Guide to specification81                    provides extensive guidance on the preparation of\nscheme designs. For naturally ventilated offices, a building width of 12\u201315m is typically used, which can be achieved\nby two spans of 6\u20137.5m            \u2014 with a column placed adjacent to a central corridor, similar to the arrangement shown in\nFig. 8.3. Natural lighting can also play an important role in determining the width of floor plate (Figure 8.12). This, and\nmany other helpful rules of thumb relating to sustainable building design, can be found in 101 Rules of thumb for low\nenergy architecture82 and          101 Rules of thumb for sustainable buildings and cities83 .\nFigure 8.12:      Depth of daylight penetration\n                                                                                                                    727\nIn larger buildings, a long-span solution provides a considerable enhancement in flexibility of layout. For air-conditioned\noffices, a clear span of 15\u201318m is often used. Fig. 8.4 gives an indicative column layout/grid arrangement for a\nmechanically ventilated steel framed office building with a central atrium.\n\nResidential (including bedroom floors to hotels and student accommodation)\nResidential buildings can vary significantly in their size and nature, which complicates giving advice on their\nassociated structural grids/solutions. Large apartment blocks can be designed in a similar way to office blocks,\nas described, with correspondingly similar column centres/structural grids. Alternatively, the requirement for walls at\nrelatively close centres (to separate rooms/apartments) can be utilised structurally, with loadbearing walls constructed\nfrom a range of materials (Figs. 8.6\u20138.9).\n\nFig. 8.5 shows a typical floor layout to a multi-storey residential building, in which CLT wall panels have been used.\nA similar floor layout could easily apply to structures utilising loadbearing masonry, reinforced concrete, or light gauge\nsteel stud walls.\n\nCar parks\nThe structural grid/column locations to multi-storey car parks, and any buildings containing a car park within their\nfootprint e.g. in the basement will, as a minimum, need to comply with the layout shown in Figure 8.13. However,\nclear-span construction would be preferable, with columns at 7.5m i.e. 3 \u00d7 2.5m centres in one direction and 16.0m\ni.e. 2 \u00d7 5.0m + 6.0m in the other, which should accommodate larger vehicles e.g. SUVs.\n\nFigure 8.13:      Indicative column layout to multi-storey car parks\n                                      76                                     7,              2                      0", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 107, "end_char_idx": 2981, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcbd749c-87cd-4f87-939f-356850da8d0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcbd749c-87cd-4f87-939f-356850da8d0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a878b7d2-81ba-40f4-9f95-cfce2da6633f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5bebfe8118e8e23666778dff9a44116bc120eb7c035eb09073c775cc105ea49a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "106  | The Institution of Structural Engineers\n       Conceptual design of buildings\n\nTransfer structures\nA common solution is to adopt a transfer structure at ground floor level where an office, retail, residential or\nmixed-use building is constructed over a basement car park. As an alternative to using a 7.5m \u00d7 16.0m column grid\nat all levels (which would result in relatively deep beams spanning the 16.0m dimension, so relatively high\nfloor-to-floor heights), a 7.5m \u00d7 8.0m column grid could be adopted at upper levels, with the additional columns\npicked up by transfer beams or trusses above the car park (Figure 8.14).\n\nAnother good example of a transfer structure is the use of a concrete podium slab at first floor level of the TallWood\nHouse student residence building (Figs. 8.10\u20138.11), in order to create an open plan space at ground floor level.\n\nFigure 8.14:      Transfer structure over a basement car park\n\nMore elaborate transfer structures include raking columns at ground floor level (Figure 8.15), and systems which use\nthe whole height and width of the building as a transfer structure e.g. when spanning over a road or underground\nrailway lines (Figures 8.16\u20138.19).\n\nFigure 8.15:      Exposed concrete transfer columns in Spinningfields, Manchester", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1271, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "888dfab4-b7bd-437f-8ca5-069c4642fb82": {"__data__": {"id_": "888dfab4-b7bd-437f-8ca5-069c4642fb82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb8bde77-5d6c-4d2a-9021-f8e2a93dba90", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e50d1c3b8568c785206b71e8b0ba479516363ae7c07c42ab008e4fe19e5aa2ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Institution of Structural Engineers  | 107\n                                                                                                                Conceptual design of buildings\n\nFigure 8.16:      Deep truss at roof level spanning over road, Bristol\n\nFigure 8.17:      Exchange House, London              \u2014 four large steel arches to span over train lines adjacent to\nLiverpool Street station\n\nFigure 8.18:      Cannon Place, London \u2014              a series of trusses span over a combination of train lines,\narchaeological remains and a scheduled ancient monument", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 104, "end_char_idx": 679, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bff575d5-5a91-4bfc-9f28-bad83a7f4f57": {"__data__": {"id_": "bff575d5-5a91-4bfc-9f28-bad83a7f4f57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2de4b5e7-71e5-45da-8cb7-ec60ad200156", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae858658a55c0a6080af7567d70b0a12da3b5dbb7e436519d36c196d1d2dfc85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "108  | The Institution of Structural Engineers\n       Conceptual design of buildings\n\nOptimum module sizes for construction materials\nThe materials adopted may come in optimum module sizes, which should ideally inform the structural grid\ne.g. hollow-core precast floor units typically come in 1.2m wide modules, while timber panels typically come\nin multiples of 0.6m, 1.2m and 2.4m. Buildings with masonry cladding (loadbearing or non loadbearing)\nshould ideally have grids and floor-to-floor heights based on brickwork dimensions i.e. 75mm high \u00d7 225mm\nlong, allowing for 10mm mortar joints, and blockwork dimensions i.e. 225mm high \u00d7 450mm long, allowing\nfor 10mm mortar, as appropriate. Proprietary cladding and roofing systems may also come in standard\nsize panels.\n\n8.1.5 Decision 5: Spans of floor and roof structures\nThe spans of floor and roof structures are closely related to the structural grid/supports described in Section\n8.1.3. The first question to ask is: Could the floor span the distance between support (whether columns or\nloadbearing walls) without using any intermediate beams?                    \u2014 which obviously depends on the type of floor\nbeing considered. While the comments that follow do not explicitly refer to roof structures, they are also valid\nfor roofs.\n\nRoof structures are generally subject to lower variable loads than floor structures, which provides the option\nof using lightweight roof structures for many buildings. It is relatively common for concrete frame buildings to\nhave a lightweight steel roof structure, and for some (if not all) internal columns to be omitted at roof level\n(Figure 8.19).\n\nFigure 8.19:      Lightweight roof structure to multi-storey building\n                                                                                                                paeci\n                                                                                        ra *e                  Gtene\n                                                                                        FteT0 lLX Seszs\n                         Glud\n                         LAC\nFloors\nTable 8.4 provides guidance on suitable floor systems, depending on the imposed loads and the span. Where\nN/A is shown this does not necessarily mean the solution isn\u2019t possible, rather that it is not a standard solution.\nNote that this table is not exhaustive, and only gives an indication of how far typical floor systems used in the\nUK can span.\n\nIn instances where Table 8.4 is not applicable, the span-to-depth ratios given in Table 8.5 can be used to determine\nan initial size for the floor system. Further details can be obtained from the literature3\u20136,74\u201377,84\u201389, from where the\nvalues in Tables 8.4\u20138.6 have been derived/adapted.\n\nIt is interesting to note from Tables 8.4 and 8.5 the significant increase in allowable span between single and multiple\nspan floor systems e.g. by comparing the allowable spans for one-way spanning, in situ                              RC slabs.

example.\n\nBeams\nThe type of floor to be used will inform whether or not any floor beams are required. Floor (and roof) beams will be\nrequired in almost all framed structures, the only exception to this being                     in situ RC flat slab structures. Even\nloadbearing structures may require some beams locally e.g. where more open-plan areas are required, such as at\nground floor level.\n\nDue to the significant number of potential variations, including load, beam span and centres, support and propping\nconditions, it is not practical to produce a version of Table 8.4 for beams. Table 8.6 provides indicative span to\ndepth ratios for a range of timber, steel and concrete beams which are commonly used in the UK.

At concept design stage, it is likely that you will\nproduce a number of options for discussion, and potentially initial costing. Unless there is a very clear preference for\na particular solution from the project team, and/or you are very experienced, there is a danger that just considering\none option will result in you missing a better one.\n\nThe form of the structural layouts can vary at this stage, and options could be drawn up by hand or in CAD. If\nbuildings are very repetitive in nature, it may be sufficient to show just a few typical bays as opposed to the structure\nof the whole building. Some examples of concept stage structural layouts are presented in Figures 8.26\u20138.31, as well\nas in Figs. 8.3\u20138.5, presented earlier in this chapter.\n\nWhen we talk about layouts, we don\u2019t just mean floor plans, roof plans and foundation layouts, as these do not\nusually tell the full story of how the structure works              \u2014 it is a good idea to include at least one full-height\ncross-section through the building (and more if the cross-sections vary along the length of the building). It would also\nbe helpful to include any non-standard details you are proposing, so that the main contractor and associated\nsubcontractors can make appropriate allowances e.g. for cost and programme.\n\nInformation which should ideally be shown on structural layout drawings at concept design stage includes:\n\n\u2022   Typical member sizes e.g. beam, column and loadbearing wall sizes\n\u2022   Floor slab type, and span direction\n\u2022   Roof construction, and span direction\n\u2022   Foundation/substructure type(s) and sizes\n\u2022   Average weights of steel frame members at each floor and roof level\n\u2022   Reinforcement weights/m3            of concrete for any RC elements\n\u2022   Key dimensions (column-to-column dimensions, floor-to-floor heights etc.)\n\u2022

condition. So when we get the opportunity to\nshow off our creativity and ingenuity, let\u2019s make the most of it. Good examples of where we can have some fun\ninclude roof structures, atria, entrance canopies, pedestrian bridges/walkways and staircases.\n\nWe will focus here on roof structures. Whether a roof to a multi-storey building or a long-span single storey structure,\nthe relatively low variable loads on roofs, and with no requirement for the roof to be flat/level (as is required for a\nfloor), opens up a diverse range of structural solutions to explore. In terms of structural form and materials, options\ninclude the following (with some examples in Figures 8.33\u20138.37):\n\n\u2022    Conventional beams (straight, curved or tapered) in steel, timber and reinforced concrete\n\u2022    Flitch beams (straight, curved or tapered) using a hybrid of steel and timber\n\u2022    Trusses (straight, curved or tapered) in steel, timber or a hybrid of the two\n\u2022    Portal frames in steel, timber and reinforced concrete\n\u2022    Cable stayed roofs in steel, timber or a hybrid of the two\n\u2022    Arched roofs in steel, timber and reinforced concrete\n\u2022    Concrete shell roofs (singly- or doubly-curved)\n\u2022    Timber grid-shell roofs (singly- or doubly-curved)\n\u2022    Folded-plate structures (typically in either reinforced concrete or timber)\n\u2022    Membrane/fabric structures (with double/anti-clastic curvature)\n\u2022    Cable-nets\n\u2022    Air-supported structures\n\u2022    Tensegrity structures\n\nEngineers are therefore encouraged to research and collect images and details of inspirational and innovative\nsolutions, which they can potentially use on their own projects at some point in the future.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2441, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8eaf5b9a-1884-4743-9501-ec6acc2840c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8eaf5b9a-1884-4743-9501-ec6acc2840c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "165d42d5-cd82-4250-bccf-8e55ecf3d01a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9829833495f8494421b82148e4b2a4c1cce652ffc546133eddac4941444c7894", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Institution of Structural Engineers | 119Conceptual design of buildings\nFigure 8.33:  Selection of roof structure options\n                               LNLZZ                        BLEEZZ             2  LLELZZ\n                       3                  7\n                                           XXE     2\n                                                    3#T                MLL\n                                                                          712       ~d       07EXX\n                                                                                    THAL\nFigure 8.34:  Sketch showing roof structure options to Bradford Academy\n                                  2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 83, "end_char_idx": 765, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8e41fc9-6e1b-49a0-b26e-c8f2d0f580d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8e41fc9-6e1b-49a0-b26e-c8f2d0f580d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1820b0f5-4c58-4713-ba33-b41a3529ec4a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b82aa5a293ad47f5b07439a4fe4ac43bc8670a3143df03d9161c996266d1843b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "120  | The Institution of Structural Engineers\n       Conceptual design of buildings\n\nFigure 8.35:      Adopted roof structure to Bradford Academy (tied steel arch with ETFE pillows)\n\nFigure 8.36:      Exposed concrete roof structure to York College", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 249, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "287eb000-0ed3-437b-b081-4237a4c61b01": {"__data__": {"id_": "287eb000-0ed3-437b-b081-4237a4c61b01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6fcc4f93-4cb7-418a-8bec-6bf532531415", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f46444620aaeeea3052e64d9daaf67be4fe0e30620c9fdced830ceb14ac5bc38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Institution of Structural Engineers  | 121\n                                                                                                                 Conceptual design of buildings\n\nFigure 8.37:      Steel   \u2018trees\u2019 supporting steel roof structure to Teesside University\n\n8.4 Movement joints, lateral stability and robustness\nDue to their complexity, movement joints, lateral stability and robustness are covered in detail in Chapter 9, but they\nare fundamental structural issues which need detailed consideration at concept design stage. Making changes later is\nlikely to involve a significant amount of re-design, re-drawing and re-modelling for the design team, and potentially\nsubcontractors, which somebody will have to pay for.\n\n8.5 Foundations\nFoundations are covered in detail in Chapter 7. It is important to think about potential foundation solutions at\nconcept design stage, since subsequent changes could prove costly and/or delay the project. In some cases,\nthe foundation/substructure design could have a significant influence on the design of the superstructure being\nsupported. Good examples of this are shown in Figures 8.17\u20138.18, where the presence of significant constraints\nbelow ground (train lines and archaeological remains) informed the structural frame solutions.\n\n8.6 Practical examples\nIn Chapter 11 we look at three relatively common types of building in the UK \u2014                            a ten-storey office block, a 30m\nspan single-storey building, and a three-storey residential building. For each building type, two potential structural\nconcepts are presented.\n\nWhile these solutions cover a range of structural forms and materials, consider that many other solutions are\npossible. Furthermore the          \u2018best solution\u2019    for any given project (if one exists, since in reality there will often be a\nnumber of potentially valid solutions) will depend on a diverse range of considerations, many of which will be\nproject-specific.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 105, "end_char_idx": 2080, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"1b05869c-6fdb-4b96-8842-b7e791410194": {"node_ids": ["ebbb4c5e-cbd1-496b-b3ed-a5c16117ddea"], "metadata": {}}, "9686dfcd-e5ca-46b4-a7f6-b3e524df4cc8": {"node_ids": ["2cd52093-c117-463f-905a-f94be7c76ff6"], "metadata": {}}, "30795bbb-689d-410d-8657-26bba516cd81": {"node_ids": ["b324493c-c28e-4465-ad81-7de0ed3f3c1c"], "metadata": {}}, "3a884971-a14e-4799-ba51-71e509887e77": {"node_ids": ["10113629-1cd3-41ee-9326-9a3618c7f077"], "metadata": {}}, "2276ebb7-21b8-481e-8226-47a0922e9e6a": {"node_ids": ["e67c22e5-4ca8-4622-8e3d-6525ee4145d3"], "metadata": {}}, "582790b2-c139-4f82-b698-7f9de4393c79": {"node_ids": ["482c545c-d8a3-4c01-8733-37202c3db5ca"], "metadata": {}}, "b8d1a2b0-40c9-4b91-be79-bbe4a58694a5": {"node_ids": ["4cc926ec-a98e-4881-baef-3c32cb6ba766"], "metadata": {}}, "8e716aeb-fd26-4331-bed8-b859a9765d03": {"node_ids": ["5c183609-41b5-41b7-a0c8-1effc7276390"], "metadata": {}}, "5541897f-5b82-4c49-9af0-a231916910eb": {"node_ids": ["3c677b01-27a5-4f91-85e7-f5ed8041ac22"], "metadata": {}}, "5c6d24fe-5bed-44b5-87e0-6106ac480329": {"node_ids": ["ba522805-bf6e-45ff-b269-2ab980c76f78"], "metadata": {}}, "6a3c6dbe-f02e-4a2a-9702-2b7d054e77de": {"node_ids": ["b95d452a-b427-41bc-8000-39ffcf3dabf9"], "metadata": {}}, "a878b7d2-81ba-40f4-9f95-cfce2da6633f": {"node_ids": ["dcbd749c-87cd-4f87-939f-356850da8d0c"], "metadata": {}}, "bb8bde77-5d6c-4d2a-9021-f8e2a93dba90": {"node_ids": ["888dfab4-b7bd-437f-8ca5-069c4642fb82"], "metadata": {}}, "2de4b5e7-71e5-45da-8cb7-ec60ad200156": {"node_ids": ["bff575d5-5a91-4bfc-9f28-bad83a7f4f57"], "metadata": {}}, "a9d63119-01c5-4b49-b1ab-0cb1f7d30dce": {"node_ids": ["e9c978a5-1af9-4291-b6ba-f90c69ac7b3e"], "metadata": {}}, "52d61511-8fca-4055-bddc-74b7746405dd": {"node_ids": ["9515143e-ec75-4904-972b-6b5fad0ff7fb"], "metadata": {}}, "b1cf3bab-329d-43cd-a94f-b351a1de85e9": {"node_ids": ["33252cfe-481e-47c8-bfe1-f947882193d8"], "metadata": {}}, "69126093-7c5b-4c9e-b82c-be0fb11a64e5": {"node_ids": ["e6c97b2d-1b9b-4cc4-8b93-80769c2db647"], "metadata": {}}, "fd06fee1-011a-4804-a647-bcdddfc6b893": {"node_ids": ["cd217444-2dce-4504-a72a-91a61e95cd54"], "metadata": {}}, "f4abaa72-fc5a-4d6a-872e-9bc5135825c8": {"node_ids": ["cc3d4c79-0010-4970-a69c-a1e647f80c82"], "metadata": {}}, "8e9f3041-06f9-41b7-bccd-0f0618a9301a": {"node_ids": ["27ee568d-d640-4170-afef-f71e9c3ab025"], "metadata": {}}, "c163f147-1620-4541-a80f-155e4c8a2976": {"node_ids": ["d32c2dd9-d764-457a-bf35-cfcd14f36682"], "metadata": {}}, "3c28c49d-b064-43f3-9bd0-5e7c45eaa226": {"node_ids": ["0d31abc7-6490-4aaf-affa-91a5b98103db"], "metadata": {}}, "4c9e39b7-34d7-4072-a881-e0780a3de8f4": {"node_ids": ["63345092-5666-4f09-86c2-0bd65c7dc020"], "metadata": {}}, "165d42d5-cd82-4250-bccf-8e55ecf3d01a": {"node_ids": ["8eaf5b9a-1884-4743-9501-ec6acc2840c3"], "metadata": {}}, "1820b0f5-4c58-4713-ba33-b41a3529ec4a": {"node_ids": ["c8e41fc9-6e1b-49a0-b26e-c8f2d0f580d0"], "metadata": {}}, "6fcc4f93-4cb7-418a-8bec-6bf532531415": {"node_ids": ["287eb000-0ed3-437b-b081-4237a4c61b01"], "metadata": {}}}}
